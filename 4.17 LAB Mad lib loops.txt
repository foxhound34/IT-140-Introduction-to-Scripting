# Having the input statement inside the loop and setting it to be True will run the loop indefinately until
#we give the break command
while True:
    
#found this neat little piece of code for multiple inputs.
    x,y = input().split()
#This if statement sets our break from the loop conditions    
    if x == 'quit' and y == '0':
        break
# The print statement is formated to place the second input first. Putting the inputs into a list and using reversed()
# may have also work, but i did not test it.
