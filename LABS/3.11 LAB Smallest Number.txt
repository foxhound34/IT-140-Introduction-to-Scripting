'''I rewrote the code below using an empty list that was appended, then sorted, and minimum was printed, but
Instant feedback says that was not the point of the lab and I should use conditional statements, so I am
leaving the more verbose version here'''

# Each input is converted to an integer 
# and stored in its own variable. 
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
num3 = int(input())

# Using an if statement and operators
# we can compare each number to the others printing the smallest.
if num1 < num2 < num3 or num1 < num3 < num2:
    print(num1)
elif num2 < num3 < num1 or num2 < num1 < num3:
    print(num2)
elif num3 < num2 < num1 or num3 < num1 < num2:
    print(num3)
    
#Prints smallest if both values are equal and less than the remaining value 
elif num1 == num2 and num2 < num3:
    print(num1)
elif num1 == num3 and num3 < num2:
    print(num1)
elif num2 == num3 and num3 < num1:
    print(num2)
